OrderSlot Gaming System is a fully deployed, production-ready decentralized slot gaming platform built on the Avalanche blockchain. The system features a sophisticated 4-contract architecture designed for security, fairness, and scalability.

Key Features
• Provably fair gaming with commit-reveal randomness
• Multi-token support (ORDER, ARENA, ID, LAMBO)
• Pool contribution system with rewards
• Staking requirements for security
• Automatic payout system
Technology Stack
• Solidity smart contracts
• React frontend with TypeScript
• RainbowKit wallet integration
• Avalanche C-Chain deployment
• Ethers.js blockchain interaction

🎮 Game Mechanics
Slot Game Rules
• 3x3 grid with 4 symbols: 🍒 🍋 🔔 💎
• Win conditions: 2+ matching symbols
• Payouts: 2x for 2 matches, 10x for 3 matches
• Bet range: 0.01 - 100 tokens
Bet Distribution
Team Wallet: 10%
Pool: 40%
Contributors: 15%
Jackpot: 10%
Remaining: 25%
🔄 Data Flow Architecture
1. Bet Placement
User selects token, amount, and initiates bet through OrderSlotCore

2. Randomness Generation
SecureRandomness contract generates fair random symbols via commit-reveal

3. Result Processing
Automatic payout calculation and distribution to winners and pools

🎮 How to Use the System
🎰 Playing the Slot Machine
Connect Wallet: Use RainbowKit to connect your Avalanche wallet
Stake Requirements: Ensure you have 10M ORDER tokens staked in the staking contract
Select Token: Choose from ORDER, ARENA, ID, or LAMBO tokens
Set Bet Amount: Enter amount within min/max limits for selected token
Spin: Click spin to place bet and generate random symbols
Reveal Results: Manually reveal results to see if you won
Automatic Payout: Winnings are automatically sent to your wallet
💰 Pool Contribution System
Meet Requirements: Have 10M ORDER tokens staked for pool access
Choose Token: Select which token pool to contribute to
Approve Tokens: Approve PoolManager contract to spend tokens
Contribute: Add tokens to pool (minimum amounts apply)
Earn Rewards: Receive 15% of all bet distributions based on pool share
7-Day Lock: Contributions are locked for 7 days before withdrawal
Claim Rewards: Use RewardsManager to claim accumulated rewards
⚠️ Important Warnings
Pool Contribution Risks
• 7-day lock period - no early withdrawal
• Betting winners use pool funds - risk of loss
• New contributions reset 7-day timer
• Emergency withdrawal has 10% penalty
Staking Requirements
• 10M ORDER tokens required for betting
• 10M ORDER tokens required for pool contribution
• Staking contract: 0x6c28d5be99994bEAb3bDCB3b30b0645481e835fd

🎮 Key Contract Functions
OrderSlotCore Functions
• placeBet(token, amount, secretHash)
• revealBetResult(betId)
• getTokenInfo(tokenAddress)
• calculateWinAmount(symbols, betAmount)
PoolManager Functions
• contributeToPool(token, amount)
• getUserContribution(user, token)
• getTotalContributions(token)
• emergencyWithdraw(token)
📊 Event Monitoring
Essential Events to Track
BetPlaced: player, token, amount, betId
BetResult: player, token, amount, won, winAmount, matchingSymbols
